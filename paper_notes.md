> Generally, observed and modeled median OH and HO2 agree to within combined uncertainties at the 2σ confidence level, which is ~±40%. For some seasons, this agreement is within ~±20% below 6‐km altitude. While this test finds no significant differences, OH observations increasingly exceeded modeled values at altitudes above 8 km, becoming ~35% greater, which is near the combined uncertainties.   

> This model uses the Master Chemical Mechanism, v3.3.1, for all gas‐phase reactions (Jenkin et al.,  [2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JD031685#jgrd55975-bib-0027) ; Saunders et al.,  [2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JD031685#jgrd55975-bib-0046) ). Both the Framework for 0‐D Atmospheric Modeling model framework and Master Chemical Mechanism v3.1.1 are publicly available. The standard model for this analysis was augmented with the reactions of CH3O2 + OH and C2H5O2 + OH, which cycle OH to HO2, to account for recent laboratory measurements of these rate coefficients (Assaf et al.,  [2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JD031685#jgrd55975-bib-0003) ). The model was run with the integration time set to three days with a decay time for unmeasured OVOCs (called the dilution time) of 12 hr.  

* Most of the time the model is not that great - the 40% difference band is quite interesting.  
* Would it make sense to plot the data in this format?  
* Would it make sense to try to reproduce the Brune data and see how we do?
